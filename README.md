*glTF 2.0 SDK for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.*

<!-- NOTICE: This section is duplicated in docs/INDEX.md. Please keep them in sync. -->

glTF-Transform supports reading, editing, and writing 3D models in glTF 2.0 format. Unlike 3D modeling tools â€”Â which are ideal for artistic changes to geometry, materials, and animation â€” glTF-Transform provides fast, reproducible, and lossless control of the low-level details in 3D model. The API automatically manages array indices and byte offsets, which would otherwise require careful management when editing files. These traits make it a good choice for bundling, splitting, or optimizing an existing model. It can also be used to apply quick fixes for common issues, to build a model procedurally, or to easily develop custom extensions on top of the glTF format. Because the core SDK is compatible with both Node.js and Web, glTF-Transform may be used to develop offline workflows and web applications alike.

glTF-Transform is modular:

- `@gltf-transform/core`: Core SDK, providing an expressive API to read, edit, and write glTF files.
- `@gltf-transform/extensions`: [Extensions](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/extensions.html) (optional glTF features) for the Core SDK.
- `@gltf-transform/functions`: [Functions](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/functions.html) for common glTF modifications, written using the core API.
- `@gltf-transform/cli`: [Command-line interface](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/cli.html) to apply changes quickly or in batch.
