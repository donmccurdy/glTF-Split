A glTF 2.0 SDK for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.

AGI's [glTF-Pipeline](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/gltf-pipeline/) and
Microsoft's [glTF-Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/glTF-Toolkit) are robust,
well-maintained tools for production workflows â€” I fully recommend using them for
the features the offer. However, neither covers the "long tail" of small, niche
changes to a glTF model: adjusting a material parameter, adding extensions, and so
on. For those situations, *this framework provides a better alternative to starting
from scratch, or modifying a library not designed with modularity in mind, for users
who need to write or reuse a custom transformation.*

glTF-Transform offers [CLI](#cli) and [programmatic](#programmatic) access to a library
of [packages](#packages), along with reusable utilities for extending the framework with
new features. Most packages work both in Node.js and on the web.

## Usage

### Programmatic

See full [API documentation](API.md).

```js
import { GLTFUtil, GLTFContainer, NodeIO, WebIO } from '@gltf-transform/core';
import { ao } from '@gltf-transform/ao';

const io = new WebIO();
const container = io.read( 'scene.gltf' );

// analyze
const analysis = GLTFUtil.analyze( container );

// ambient occlusion
ao( container, { samples: 1000 } );

// serialize
const glbBuffer = GLTFUtil.toGLB( container );
```

### CLI

```shell
# help
gltf-transform --help

# analyze
gltf-transform analyze input.glb

# ambient occlusion
gltf-transform ao --samples 1000 input.glb output.glb
```
## Contributing

This project consists of multiple NPM packages, managed in one repository with
https://lerna.js.org/. All code, excluding Node.js-based tests, is written in TypeScript.
I recommend using VSCode for linting and type information, which becomes very helpful
when modifying glTF schema objects.

After cloning the repository, run:

```
npm install && npm install -g lerna
lerna bootstrap
```

The command `lerna bootstrap` will install dependencies into each package, and will then
link them together. If you make changes to a package's dependencies (e.g. run
`npm install <anything>`) you will need to run `lerna link` re-create the symlinks.

To build and test all code, run:

```
npm run dist
npm run test
```

To run an arbitrary command across all packages:

```
lerna exec -- <command>
```

While working, use `npm run watch` to watch and rebuild code after changes. To use a local
version of the CLI, run `npm link` within the `packages/cli` directory. Then
`gltf-transform -h` will use local code instead of any global installation.

In the event that dependencies get into a broken state, removing `package-lock.json` and
reinstalling may resolve things.

## Releasing

> NOTE: Only the author can create new releases.

Currently Lerna [has trouble with 2FA OTPs](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1091). As a result,
new packages need to be published manually before they can be included in a repo-wide release. Once
that is done, normal releases should use:

```shell
NPM_CONFIG_OTP=123456 lerna publish <version> --force-publish=*
```
