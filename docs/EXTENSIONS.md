# Extensions

Extensions enhance a glTF {@link Document} with additional features and schema, beyond the core
glTF specification. For example, extensions to {@link Material} properties might include additional
textures or scalar properties affecting the Material's appearance in a specific way.

Common extensions may be imported from the `@gltf-transform/extensions` package, or custom
extensions may be created by extending the {@link Extension} base class. No extensions are included
in th default `@gltf-transform/core` package, in order to (1) minimize the code size, and (2)
ensure that any extension can be implemented externally.

Because extensions rely on the same underlying graph structure as the core specification,
references to {@link Texture}, {@link Accessor}, and other resources will be managed
automatically, even by scripts or transforms written without prior knowledge of the extension.
An extension is added to a Document by calling {@link Document.createExtension} with the
extension constructor. The extension object may then be used to construct
{@link ExtensionProperty} instances, which are attached to properties throughout the Document
as prescribed by the extension itself.

## Khronos Extensions

*Khronos extensions are widely supported and recommended for general use.*

<summary><b>KHR_draco_mesh_compression</b></summary>

- *Specification: [KHR_draco_mesh_compression](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression/)*
- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-draco-mesh-compression/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-draco-mesh-compression)*

The `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` extension provides advanced compression for mesh geometry. For
models where geometry is a significant factor (>1 MB), Draco can reduce filesize by ~95% in many
cases. When animation or textures are large, other complementary compression methods should be used
as well. For geometry <1MB, the size of the WASM decoder library may outweigh size savings.

Be aware that decompression happens before uploading to the GPU — this will add some latency to the
parsing process, and means that compressing geometry with  Draco does _not_ affect runtime
performance. To improve framerate, you'll need to simplify the geometry by reducing vertex count or
draw calls — not just compress it. Finally, be aware that Draco compression is lossy: repeatedly
compressing and decompressing a model in a pipeline will lose precision, so compression should
generally be the last stage of an art workflow, and uncompressed original files should be kept.

A decoder or encoder from `draco3dgltf` npm module is required for reading and writing
respectively, and must be provided by the application:

```typescript
import { NodeIO } from '@gltf-transform/core';
import { DracoMeshCompression } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

import * as draco3d from 'draco3dgltf';

// ...

const io = new NodeIO()
  .registerExtensions([DracoMeshCompression])
  .registerDependencies({
    'draco3d.decoder': await draco3d.createDecoderModule(), // Optional.
    'draco3d.encoder': await draco3d.createEncoderModule(), // Optional.
  });

const doc = io.read('compressed.glb');
```

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-lights-punctual/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-lights-punctual)*

The `KHR_lights_punctual` extension defines three "punctual" light types: directional, point and
spot. Punctual lights are defined as parameterized, infinitely small points that emit light in
well-defined directions and intensities. Lights are referenced by nodes and inherit the transform
of that node.

```typescript
import { LightsPunctual, Light, LightType } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const lightsExtension = document.createExtension(LightsPunctual);

// Create a Light property.
const light = lightsExtension.createLight()
  .setType(LightType.POINT)
  .setIntensity(2.0)
  .setColor([1.0, 0.0, 0.0]);

// Attach the property to a Material.
node.setExtension('KHR_lights_punctual', light);

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-clearcoat/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-clearcoat)*

The `KHR_materials_clearcoat` extension defines a clear coating that can be layered on top of an
existing glTF material definition. A clear coat is a common technique used in Physically-Based
Rendering to represent a protective layer applied to a base material.

The `MaterialsClearcoat` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `Clearcoat`, which
may be attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsClearcoat, Clearcoat } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const clearcoatExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsClearcoat);

// Create a Clearcoat property.
const clearcoat = clearcoatExtension.createClearcoat()
  .setClearcoatFactor(1.0);

// Attach the property to a Material.
material.setExtension('KHR_materials_clearcoat', clearcoat);

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-ior/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-ior)*

The dielectric BRDF of the metallic-roughness material in glTF uses a fixed value of 1.5 for the
index of refraction. This is a good fit for many plastics and glass, but not for other materials
like water or asphalt, sapphire or diamond. `KHR_materials_ior` allows users to set the index of
refraction to a certain value.

The `MaterialsIOR` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `IOR`, which
may be attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsIOR, IOR } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const iorExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsIOR);

// Create a IOR property.
const ior = iorExtension.createIOR().setIOR(1.0);

// Attach the property to a Material.
material.setExtension('KHR_materials_ior', ior);

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-pbr-specular-glossiness/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-pbr-specular-glossiness)*

`KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness` converts a PBR material from the default metal/rough workflow
to a spec/gloss workflow. The spec/gloss workflow does _not_ support other PBR extensions such as
clearcoat, transmission, IOR, etc. For the complete PBR feature set and specular data, use the
`KHR_materials_specular` extension instead of this one, which provides specular data within a
metal/rough workflow.

The `MaterialsPBRSpecularGlossiness` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `PBRSpecularGlossiness`, which
may be attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsPBRSpecularGlossiness, PBRSpecularGlossiness } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const specGlossExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsPBRSpecularGlossiness);

// Create a PBRSpecularGlossiness property.
const specGloss = specGlossExtension.createPBRSpecularGlossiness()

`KHR_materials_sheen` defines a sheen that can be layered on top of an existing glTF material
definition. A sheen layer is a common technique used in Physically-Based Rendering to represent
cloth and fabric materials.

The `MaterialsSheen` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `Sheen`, which
may be attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsSheen, Sheen } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const sheenExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsSheen);

// Create a Sheen property.
const sheen = sheenExtension.createSheen()

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-specular/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-specular)*

`KHR_materials_specular` allows users to configure the strength of the specular reflection in the
dielectric BRDF. A value of zero disables the specular reflection, resulting in a pure diffuse
material.

The `MaterialsSpecular` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `Specular`, which
may be attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsSpecular, Specular } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const specularExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsSpecular);

// Create a Specular property.
const specular = specularExtension.createSpecular()

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-transmission/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-transmission)*

The `KHR_materials_transmission` This extension aims to address the simplest and most common use
cases for optical transparency: infinitely-thin materials with no refraction, scattering, or
dispersion. When combined with `KHR_materials_volume`, transmission may be used for thicker
materials and refractive effects.

The `MaterialsTransmission` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `Transmission`, which
may be attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsTransmission, Transmission } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const transmissionExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsTransmission);

// Create a Transmission property.
const transmission = transmissionExtension.createTransmission()

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-unlit/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-unlit)*

The `KHR_materials_unlit` extension defines an unlit shading model for use in glTF 2.0 materials,
as an alternative to the Physically Based Rendering (PBR) shading models provided by the core
specification.

The `MaterialsUnlit` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `Unlit`, which may be
attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsUnlit, Unlit } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const unlitExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsUnlit);

// Create an Unlit property.
const unlit = unlitExtension.createUnlit();

<summary><b>KHR_materials_variants</b></summary>

- *Specification: [KHR_materials_variants](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_variants/)*
- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-variants/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-variants)*

`KHR_materials_variants` defines alternate {@link Material} states for any {@link Primitive} in the
scene, for uses including product configurators, night/day states, healthy/damaged
states, etc. Mesh geometry cannot be changed by this extension, although another extension
(tentative: `KHR_mesh_variants`) is under consideration by the Khronos Group, for that purpose.

The `MaterialsVariants` class provides three {@link ExtensionProperty} types: `Variant`, `Mapping`,
and `MappingList`. When attached to {@link Primitive} properties, these offer flexible ways of
defining the variants available to an application. Triggering a variant is out of scope of this
extension, but could be handled in the application with a UI dropdown, particular game states, and
so on.

```typescript
import { MaterialsVariants } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const variantsExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsVariants);

// Create some Variant states.
const healthyVariant = variantExtension.createVariant('Healthy');
const damagedVariant = variantExtension.createVariant('Damaged');

// Create mappings from a Variant state to a Material.
const healthyMapping = variantExtension.createMapping()
  .addVariant(healthyVariant)
  .setMaterial(healthyMat);
const damagedMapping = variantExtension.createMapping()
  .addVariant(damagedVariant)
  .setMaterial(damagedMat);

// Attach the mappings to a Primitive.
primitive.setExtension(
  'KHR_materials_variants',
  variantExtension.createMappingList()
    .addMapping(healthyMapping)
    .addMapping(damagedMapping)
);
```

A few notes about this extension:

1. Viewers that don't recognized this extension will show the default material for each primitive
   instead, so assign that material accordingly. This material can be — but doesn't have to be —
   associated with one of the available variants.
2. Mappings can list multiple Variants. In that case, the first Mapping containing an active
   Variant will be chosen by the viewer.
3. Variant names are how these states are identified, so choose informative names.
4. When writing the file to an unpacked `.gltf`, instead of an embedded `.glb`, viewers will have
   the option of downloading only textures associated with the default state, and lazy-loading
   any textures for inactive Variants only when they are needed.

<summary><b>KHR_materials_volume</b></summary>

- *Specification: [KHR_materials_volume](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_volume/)*
- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-volume/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-materials-volume)*

By default, a glTF 2.0 material describes the scattering properties of a surface enclosing an
infinitely thin volume. The surface defined by the mesh represents a thin wall. The volume
extension makes it possible to turn the surface into an interface between volumes. The mesh to
which the material is attached defines the boundaries of an homogeneous medium and therefore must
be manifold. Volumes provide effects like refraction, absorption and scattering. Scattering effects
will require future (TBD) extensions.

The volume extension must be combined with `KHR_materials_transmission` or
`KHR_materials_translucency` in order to define entry of light into the volume.

The `MaterialsVolume` class provides a single {@link ExtensionProperty} type, `Volume`, which
may be attached to any {@link Material} instance. For example:

```typescript
import { MaterialsVolume, Volume } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const volumeExtension = document.createExtension(MaterialsVolume);

// Create a Volume property.
const volume = volumeExtension.createVolume()
  .setThicknessFactor(1.0)
  .setThicknessTexture(texture)
  .setAttenuationDistance(1.0)
  .setAttenuationColorHex(0xFFEEEE);

// Attach the property to a Material.
material.setExtension('KHR_materials_volume', volume);
```

A thickness texture is required in most realtime renderers, and can be baked in software such as
Blender or Substance Painter. When `thicknessFactor = 0`, all volumetric effects are disabled.

<summary><b>KHR_mesh_quantization</b></summary>

- *Specification: [KHR_mesh_quantization](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/)*
- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-mesh-quantization/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-mesh-quantization)*

The `KHR_mesh_quantization` extension expands the set of allowed component types for mesh attribute
storage to provide a memory/precision tradeoff — depending on the application needs, 16-bit or
8-bit storage can be sufficient.

Defining no {@link ExtensionProperty} types, this {@link Extension} is simply attached to the
{@link Document}, and affects the entire Document by allowing more flexible use of {@link Accessor}
types for vertex attributes. Without the Extension, the same use of these data types would yield
an invalid glTF document, under the stricter core glTF specification.

```typescript
import { MeshQuantization } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const quantizationExtension = document.createExtension(MeshQuantization).setRequired(true);
```

<summary><b>KHR_texture_basisu</b></summary>

- *Specification: [KHR_texture_basisu](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu)*
- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-texture-basisu/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-texture-basisu)*

The `KHR_texture_basisu` extension adds the ability to use KTX2 GPU textures with Basis Universal
supercompression for any material texture. GPU texture formats, unlike traditional image formats,
remain compressed in GPU memory. As a result, they (1) upload to the GPU much more quickly, and (2)
require much less GPU memory. In certain cases they may also have smaller filesizes than PNG or
JPEG textures, but this is not guaranteed. GPU textures often require more careful tuning during
compression to maintain image quality, but this extra effort is worthwhile for applications that
need to maintain a smooth framerate while uploading images, or where GPU memory is limited.

Defining no {@link ExtensionProperty} types, this {@link Extension} is simply attached to the
{@link Document}, and affects the entire Document by allowing use of the `image/ktx2` MIME type
and passing KTX2 image data to the {@link Texture.setImage} method. Without the Extension, the
same MIME types and image data would yield an invalid glTF document, under the stricter core glTF
specification.

```typescript
import { TextureBasisu } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const basisuExtension = document.createExtension(TextureBasisu)
  .setRequired(true);
document.createTexture('MyCompressedTexture')
  .setMimeType('image/ktx2')
  .setImage(fs.readFileSync('my-texture.ktx2'));
```

Compression is not done automatically when adding the extension as shown above — you must compress
the image data first, then pass the `.ktx2` payload to {@link Texture.setImage}. The [glTF-Transform
CLI](/cli.html) has functions to help with this, or any similar KTX2-capable utility will work.

When the `KHR_texture_basisu` extension is added to a file by glTF-Transform, the extension should
always be required. This tool does not support writing assets that "fall back" to optional PNG or
JPEG image data.

> **NOTICE:** Compressing some textures — particularly 3-component (RGB) normal maps, and
occlusion/roughness/metalness maps, may give poor results with the ETC1S compression option. These
issues can often be avoided with the larger UASTC compression option, or by upscaling the texture
before compressing it.
>
> For best results when authoring new textures, use
> [texture dilation](https://docs.substance3d.com/spdoc/padding-134643719.html) and minimize
> prominent UV seams.

- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/khr-texture-transform/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/khr-texture-transform)*

The `KHR_texture_transform` extension adds offset, rotation, and scale to {@link TextureInfo}
properties, applying an affine transform on the UV coordinates. UV transforms are useful for
reducing the number of textures the GPU must load, improving performance when used in techniques
like texture atlases. UV transforms cannot be animated at this time.

```typescript
import { TextureTransform } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const transformExtension = document.createExtension(TextureTransform)
  .setRequired(true);

// Create a reusable Transform.
const transform = transformExtension.createTransform()
  .setScale([100, 100]);

// Apply the Transform to a Material's baseColorTexture.
document.createMaterial()
  .setBaseColorTexture(myTexture)
  .getBaseColorTextureInfo()
  .setExtension('KHR_texture_transform', transform);
```

## Vendor Extensions

*Multi-vendor extensions should be considered last-mile optimizations for a specific application.
glTF files using `EXT_*` extensions are not widely portable, nor officially endorsed by Khronos,
and will not be supported in all applications. It may be difficult to edit a glTF file after
applying these extensions.*

<summary><b>EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing</b></summary>

- *Specification: [EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing/)*
- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/ext-mesh-gpu-instancing/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/ext-mesh-gpu-instancing)*

The `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` extension prepares mesh data for efficient GPU instancing, allowing
engines to render many copies of a single mesh at once using a small number of draw calls. Instancing
is particularly useful for things like trees, grass, road signs, etc. Keep in mind that predefined
batches, as used in this extension, may prevent frustum culling within a batch. Dividing batches
into collocated cells may be preferable to using a single large batch.

> **Implementation Note:** While this extension stores mesh data optimized for GPU instancing, it
is important to note that (1) GPU instancing and other optimizations are possible — and encouraged
— even without this extension, and (2) other common meanings of the term "instancing" exist,
distinct from this extension. See [Appendix: Motivation and Purpose](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing#appendix-motivation-and-purpose)
of the `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` specification.

```typescript
import { MeshGPUInstancing } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create standard mesh, node, and scene hierarchy.
// ...

// Assign positions for each instance.
const batchPositions = doc.createAccessor('instance_positions')
  .setArray(new Float32Array([
    0, 0, 0,
    1, 0, 0,
    2, 0, 0,
  ]))
  .setType(Accessor.Type.VEC3)
  .setBuffer(buffer);

// Assign IDs for each instance.
const batchIDs = doc.createAccessor('instance_ids')
  .setArray(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]))
  .setType(Accessor.Type.SCALAR)
  .setBuffer(buffer);

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const batchExtension = document.createExtension(MeshGPUInstancing)
  .setRequired(true);
const batch = batchExtension.createInstancedMesh()
  .setAttribute('TRANSLATION', batchPositions)
  .setAttribute('_ID', batchIDs);

node
  .setMesh(mesh)
  .setExtension('EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing', batch);
```

Standard instance attributes are `TRANSLATION`, `ROTATION`, and `SCALE`, and support the accessor
types allowed by the extension specification. Custom instance attributes are allowed, and should
be prefixed with an underscore (`_*`).

<summary><b>EXT_texture_webp</b></summary>

- *Specification: [EXT_texture_webp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_texture_webp/)*
- *Source: [packages/extensions/src/ext-texture-webp/](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions/src/ext-texture-webp)*

The `EXT_texture_webp` extension adds the ability to use WebP images for any material texture. WebP
typically provides the smallest transmission size, but [requires browser support](https://caniuse.com/webp).
Like PNG and JPEG, a WebP image is *fully decompressed* when uploaded to the GPU, which increases
upload time and GPU memory cost. For seamless uploads and minimal GPU memory cost, it is necessary
to use a GPU texture format like Basis Universal, with the `KHR_texture_basisu` extension.

Defining no {@link ExtensionProperty} types, this {@link Extension} is simply attached to the
{@link Document}, and affects the entire Document by allowing use of the `image/webp` MIME type
and passing WebP image data to the {@link Texture.setImage} method. Without the Extension, the
same MIME types and image data would yield an invalid glTF document, under the stricter core glTF
specification.

```typescript
import { TextureWebP } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

// Create an Extension attached to the Document.
const webpExtension = document.createExtension(TextureWebP)
  .setRequired(true);
document.createTexture('MyWebPTexture')
  .setMimeType('image/webp')
  .setImage(fs.readFileSync('my-texture.webp'));
```

WebP conversion is not done automatically when adding the extension as shown above — you must
convert the image data first, then pass the `.webp` payload to {@link Texture.setImage}.

When the `EXT_texture_webp` extension is added to a file by glTF-Transform, the extension should
always be required. This tool does not support writing assets that "fall back" to optional PNG or
JPEG image data.

</details>

## Installation

To use extensions, first install the `@gltf-transform/extensions` package:

```shell
npm install --save @gltf-transform/extensions
```

To open files containing an {@link Extension}, the Extension constructor must be registered with
the {@link PlatformIO} instance used to read the file.

```typescript
// Register all Khronos Group (KHR_) extensions.
import { WebIO } from '@gltf-transform/core';
import { KHRONOS_EXTENSIONS } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';
const io = new WebIO().registerExtensions(KHRONOS_EXTENSIONS);

// Register an individual extension.
import { WebIO } from '@gltf-transform/core';
import { MaterialsUnlit } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';
const io = new WebIO().registerExtensions([MaterialsUnlit]);

// Read a file that requires the KHR_materials_unlit extension.
const doc = await io.readGLB('unlit.glb');
```

Reading files requires registering the necessary Extensions, but writing files does not — the
Extension objects are already attached to the Document itself. Some extensions may require
installing dependencies:

```typescript
import { NodeIO } from '@gltf-transform/core';
import { KHRONOS_EXTENSIONS } from '@gltf-transform/extensions';

import * as draco3d from 'draco3dgltf';

// ...

const io = new NodeIO()
  .registerExtensions(KHRONOS_EXTENSIONS)
  .registerDependencies({
    'draco3d.decoder': await draco3d.createDecoderModule(), // Optional.
    'draco3d.encoder': await draco3d.createEncoderModule(), // Optional.
  });

const doc = io.read('compressed.glb');
```

## Custom extensions

In addition to the official Khronos and multi-vendor extensions, the glTF format can be extended
with [custom extensions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/extensions/README.md)
for specific applications. glTF-Transform supports reading/writing custom extensions, without
modifications to the core codebase. Any extension implemented correctly and registered with the I/O
instance may be read from a file, modified programmatically, and written back to a file.

For implementation examples, see [packages/extensions](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform/tree/master/packages/extensions).
For further details on the general Extension API, see {@link Extension} and
{@link ExtensionProperty}.
